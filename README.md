# UFOs

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to allow for users to filter and view information about UFO sighting based on date, city, state, country, and shape. This allows for a more interactive webpage that can be individualized to each user and what their needs are.

## Results

Below are examples of results that can be retrieved through the use of the filtered searches. In the single search example only one filter value was used to narrow the table down. In the multi-entry searches we were able to be more specific in understanding UFO sightings based on multiple criteria such as state, date, and shape.

## Summary

After completing this project there was one drawback to the new design. All filtered values had to be an exact search for what you were looking for, including not just spelling, but also capitalization. If you did not know the correct values to seek especially for the shape it would be difficult to narrow your search and determine if there really were no sightings with that criteria or if your search was incorrect. For further development I would include areas of the filter to be an autofill or suggested locations city and state and for shapes of the UFO i would categorize them and have them as a radio button option.
